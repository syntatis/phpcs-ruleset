A collection of rulesets to apply standard PHP coding practices. The rulesets are based on some established PHP coding standards, such as [PSR-12](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/), [Doctrine](https://github.com/doctrine/coding-standard), [Slevomat](https://github.com/slevomat/coding-standard), and are extended with a few additional rules to suit with the specific projects' needs.
